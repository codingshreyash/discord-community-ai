      "content": "hello, im currently a junior that just switched over to CS. id appreciate some feedback on my resume (only gotten one interview so far). in addition to any feedback i also had two questions:\n\n- I am currently still a uta, but in my resume I marked it as if it ended last semester, mostly because i wanted to keep internship experience at the top. should i change it to say Janurary 2024-present, and if so should i keep it below or above my internship experience?\n- probably doesn't matter as much but should i used to have \"Programming Languages\" and \"Frameworks\" at the top of my resume (above education but below my links), and i just moved it to my skills section all the way in the bottom. Should I move them back up?",
