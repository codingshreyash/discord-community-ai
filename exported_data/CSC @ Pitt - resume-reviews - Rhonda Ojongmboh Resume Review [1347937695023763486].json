      "content": "I agree with everything Nathan said. I think removing the professional summary would open up more opportunities for you than just fintech. I was in a similar boat with you in terms of major switch (civil engineering -> cs) and some unwarranted advice from my experience of getting my first internship after the switch was to look local and to look for something similar to your first major, but that also has crossover into anything at all relevant to cs. Some things that I would also recommend:\n\n - Remove your location, most job applications require you to specify your location, having this could limit you with job selection\n - Mention some course work or projects from your previous major maybe. From your coursework I'm guessing you were some type of engineering or other stem field which could be very indirectly relevant to CS\n - The Quadcopter project sounds very interesting and relevant, definitely expand on that. Are there any numbers/statistics that you could talk about?\n\nI think expanding on the quadcopter project and including some context about switching majors late (and why that potentially makes you a better candidate) could be beneficial to you. Switching majors late is definitely difficult but just stay positive, keep grinding, and everything will work out",
