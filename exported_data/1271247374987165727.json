I was not given the position based on my qualifications, but I genuinely made a positive tangible impact with the work that I did so I want to put it on my resume. My main question: would yall recommend that I mention on my resume/linkedin that it was my family member's business? I don't want to come across to employers as a nepo kid who takes credit for what was handed to him, but i also don't want to unnecessarily undermine my achievements.",
